# Voice_assistant
This is a Python-based Voice Assistant that responds to spoken commands. The beginner version performs basic tasks like greetings, telling the time/date, and searching the web. The advanced version can send emails, set reminders, provide weather updates, control smart devices, and integrate with third-party APIs for more features.
